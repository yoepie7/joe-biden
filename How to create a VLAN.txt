To create a VLAN and change its name, IP address, and DHCP trunk configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer, follow these steps:

Step 1: Access the Switch CLI
Double-click on the switch to open the configuration window. Click on the "CLI" tab to access the Command Line Interface.

Step 2: Create a VLAN
To create a VLAN, use the following command:
```
vlan vlan_id
```
Replace `vlan_id` with the desired VLAN ID. Repeat this command for each VLAN you want to create.

Step 3: Change VLAN Name
To change the name of a VLAN, use the following command:
```
vlan vlan_id
name vlan_name
```
Replace `vlan_id` with the VLAN ID of the VLAN you want to rename, and `vlan_name` with the desired name for the VLAN.

Step 4: Assign IP Address
To assign an IP address to a VLAN, use the following command:
```
interface vlan vlan_id
ip address ip_address subnet_mask
```
Replace `vlan_id` with the VLAN ID of the VLAN you want to configure, `ip_address` with the desired IP address, and `subnet_mask` with the subnet mask you want to use.

Step 5: Enable DHCP Trunk
To enable DHCP trunking on a VLAN, use the following command:
```
interface vlan vlan_id
ip helper-address dhcp_server_ip
```
Replace `vlan_id` with the VLAN ID of the VLAN you want to configure, and `dhcp_server_ip` with the IP address of the DHCP server.

Step 6: Save the Configuration
To save the configuration, type the following command:
```
write
```
This will save the configuration to the switch's memory.

Step 7: Test the Configuration
Once you have completed the VLAN configuration, you can test the connectivity and DHCP functionality within the VLAN.

That's it! You have now created a VLAN, changed its name, IP address, and configured DHCP trunking in Cisco Packet Tracer. Remember to save your project so you can come back to it later if needed.
