To change the root bridge to another switch in a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) network, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the current root bridge:
   - Enter the privileged EXEC mode:
     ```
     enable
     ```
   - View the current STP information:
     ```
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - Look for the line that starts with "Root ID" or "Bridge ID." It will display the current root bridge's MAC address and priority.

2. Identify the switch you want to become the new root bridge:
   - Review the list of switches connected in your network topology.
   - Determine the desired switch that you want to set as the new root bridge.

3. Access the CLI of the desired switch:
   - Enter the privileged EXEC mode:
     ```
     enable
     ```
   - Enter the global configuration mode:
     ```
     configure terminal
     ```

4. Configure the new priority for the desired switch:
   - Set the priority value lower than the current root bridge's priority. The default priority value is 32768.
     ```
     spanning-tree vlan <vlan_id> priority <new_priority>
     ```
   - Replace `<vlan_id>` with the VLAN ID on which you want to change the root bridge priority.
   - Replace `<new_priority>` with a lower priority value than the current root bridge's priority.

5. Verify the changes:
   - Enter the privileged EXEC mode:
     ```
     enable
     ```
   - View the updated STP information:
     ```
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - Check the "Root ID" or "Bridge ID" line to confirm that the new switch has become the root bridge.

Remember that changing the root bridge may impact the network's spanning tree topology. It's recommended to plan and test any changes carefully to avoid disruptions in the network.
